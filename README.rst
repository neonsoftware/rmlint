**Features:**

Finds…

- …Duplicate Files and duplicate directories.
- …Nonstripped binaries (i.e. binaries with debug symbols)
- …Broken symbolic links.
- …Empty files and directories.
- …Files with broken user or/and group ID.

**Differences to other duplicate finders:**

- Extremely fast (no exaggeration, we promise!)
- Paranoia mode for those who do not trust hashsums.
- Many output formats.
- No interactivity.
- Search for files only newer than a certain ``mtime``.
- Many ways to handle duplicates.
- Caching and replaying.
- ``btrfs`` support.
- ...

It runs and compiles under most Unices, including Linux, FreeBSD and Darwin.
The main target is Linux though, some optimisations might not be available
elsewhere.
